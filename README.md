# Human Activity Monitoring System (IoT & NoSQL)

A cloud-based IoT monitoring system designed to track human activity (Heart Rate and Body Temperature) using **MongoDB Atlas**. This project involves time-series data management, complex aggregation pipelines, and visual analytics.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **IoT Data Flow**: Documented data flow from sensors to a cloud-based NoSQL database.
* **NoSQL Database**: Built on MongoDB Atlas with optimized indexing for time-series performance.
* **Data Analytics**: 5 custom MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines to analyze heart rate trends and relationships between activities.
* **Visualizations**: Live dashboard created using MongoDB Atlas Charts.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (NoSQL)
* **Language**: Python (Jupyter Notebook)
* **Visualization**: MongoDB Atlas Charts
* **Tools**: GitHub, IoT System Simulation
